# Big Mac's Around the World

This is a Next.js app that allows user's to compare their local country's Big Mac price to another random country. First, the site grabs the user's IP address to locate their country. It will generate a random country as well and once an input of money is entered, the site will tell the user how many Big Mac's they can buy, and compare how many Big Mac's they can buy in the random country as well.
